	</div>

	<p> My name is Ty Simpson. I'm aiming to get my Associate's Degree in Information Technology, with a focus on computer programming. As someone who grew up with computers and the internet, technology has been an integral part of my life and I quickly became fascinated with how it all worked. Even before going entering this degree program, I was looking up HTML codes to make my Myspace (I guess that kind of dates me, huh?) page stand out more. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>I believe innovation and technology should be paired with empathy for others who are less fortunate. I truly think that an invention used to improve the lives of people who already live well, while fun, is redundant and uneccessary. An invention that can enrich the lives of those who have little is truly innovative. We need more advancements in technology to feed the starving than we need UberEats. There are so many creative programmers out in the world who's talents are being used on another frivilous streaming app than there are working towards progress. Don't get me wrong - I absolutely love streaming apps, food delivery services, and all the other fun apps that are out there - I just wish more resources were being used to ease the lives of the needy.   </p>
